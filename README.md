### Objective:
As a data scientist at FlyHomes, my role is to delve into the house sales data in the King County area. The task involves building predictive models for sale prices and pinpointing the factors that significantly influence house prices.
/* Business Question:*/
Location: Which areas in King County command the highest average house prices?
Inner Factors: What house features have the most substantial impact on the sale price?
External Factors: How do external elements such as property tax rates, school ratings, and demographic data sway house prices in King County?
Goalï¼š
This project aims to guide potential investors and homebuyers in making informed decisions in the King County real estate market.
### Data Used for this Project

I have merged five different datasets based on zip code to construct a new dataset for predicting house prices

### Data Processing
1. What does the raw data sets look like? E.g., How many variables total? How many are Quantitative? How many are Qualitative? Total unique observation?
2. What you have done in data cleaning step(s), and why do you clear the data like that? E.g., Did you remove any missing value? How many?
3. Did you do any data reformatting/data transformation data? E.g., How many variables are highly skewed? Which one(s)? Did you do any transformation? Why did you choose that particular transformation? See Data_Transformation_Guide
4. Attach the raw data as well as your cleaned data.
### Project Progress Log 4 -- Model Design
1. Which data analytic methods do you originally plan to apply? Include diagrams of your modeling plans, e.g., identify clusters, then do backward regression...
2. Explain why you think those methods would be suitable for your data modeling
3. What kinds of tools do you plan to use to implement the model and why? Difference tools have different purpose, please be specific.
4. At this moment, you should at least completed some prelim checking, e.g, matrix plot, please share your results, findings, and thoughts:
   Which variables are highly correlated with each other?
   What else you have done so far
   Any "expected" results? List the expected results and state why they are expected.
   Any "surprising" results? List the surprising results and state why you are surprised.
   Any action plans in mind at this moment?
5. Attach your modelling work up to date, including but limited to print screens, R/Python files, draft report,...
### Project Progress Log 5 -- Model Implementation
1. Which functions/algorithms you have completed in Method 1 you designed last week? Using with software?
2. Please share your results, findings, and thoughts:
   Any "expected" results? List the expected results and state why they are expected.
   Any "surprising" results? List the surprising results and state why you are surprised.
   Any action plans in mind at this moment?
3. Which functions/algorithms you have completed in Method 2 you designed last week? Using with software?
4. Please share your results, findings, and thoughts:
   Any "expected" results? List the expected results and state why they are expected.
   Any "surprising" results? List the surprising results and state why you are surprised.
   Any action plans in mind at this moment?
6. Attach your modelling work up to date, including but limited to print screens, R/Python files, draft report,...
### Project Progress Log 6 -- Model Improvement
1. What are your action plans from last week? Please list with details.
2. Outlier removal:
   How did you define an outlier in the model? Which "thread hold" did you use (e.g., larger than the absolute value of the        standardized residual)?
   List your identified outliers.
   Based on your overall data, do you believe those (or any of those) observations are truly outliers? Why or why not?
   Include the model results after you have removed those identified outliers. Any new packages/libraries you applied in model
   improvement?
   Is there any improvement in your "new" model? Include any "evidence" to show the improvement of the model (e.g., adjusted r
   squared increased from __ to __)  
3. Factor elimination:
   Which method(s) did you use to identify factors that are not significant (e.g., Backward Elimination)? Which "thread hold"
   did you use (e.g., p-value for ___ test is great than ____)?
   List the factors you removed.
   Based on your overall data, do you believe those (or any of those) factors are truly insignificant? Why or why not?
   Include the model results after you have removed those factors. Any new packages/libraries you applied in model improvement
   Is there any improvement in your "new" model? Include any "evidence" to show the improvement of the model (e.g., adjusted r
   squared increased from __ to __)
4. Others: list any other ways you have tried to improve the model. For example, sampling? clustering?
5. What kinds of difficulties that you have encountered when improving the model? How do you overcome them?
   Any "expected" results? List the expected results and state why they are expected.
   Any "surprising" results? List the surprising results and state why you are surprised.
   Any action plans in mind at this moment?
6. Attach your modelling work up to date, including but limited to print screens, R/Python files, draft report,...
### Project Progress Log 7 -- Model Validation and Comparison 
1. Now, combine all your dimensions you have used to complete the single dimension modeling, and run an overall model -- meaning you should include all variables (factors and dimensions). You are highly encouraged to complete this part as a group!
   Which data analytic methods you have applied? Why this method(s) is suitable for your data? Why this method is the same (or
   different) from the one you applied to your single dimension modeling?
   Which functions/algorithms you have completed? Are these the same ones as you applied to your single dimension modeling?
   Any "expected" results? List the expected results and state why they are expected.
   Any "surprising" results? List the surprising results and state why you are surprised.
   Any action plans in mind at this moment?
   Any "pattern" or anything interesting you can find connect to single dimension modeling?
   Are your results the same as your team members? Point out the similarities and differences.
2. Which method(s) did you use to validate the model? Why did you choose such method(s)? Please list with details.
3. Are your models valid? Why or why not? Please include output
4. If your models are invalid, any action plans?
5. Prepare a table to compare your overall models and your dimension models (models based on single dimension). Which key measurements/results you would like to compare? Why or why not?
6. Based on the table, are you able to find any "pattern" or anything interesting? If so, what is it? Any action plans?
7. Attach your modelling work up to date, including but limited to print screens, R/Python files, draft report,...
### Project Progress Log 8 -- Finalize Model and Prepare Final Report

2. Include at least the following sections: Introduction, Data, Methodology, Modeling, Analysis of Results / Model improvement, Validation, Discussion and Conclusion.
3. Include any feedback from the final presentation.
4. Include references / citation at the end (e.g., Kaggle).
